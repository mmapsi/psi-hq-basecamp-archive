      ✨ SBAC Growth Scores coming to CA
      
    </h1>

      <div>I sat in on the policy review board for Derek on Friday. There are some proposed changes to the report card, but mostly that was about what the state doesn't have data on. The two big changes coming this year on testing are:</div><ul><li>There will be definitely be testing using a shortened version of the SBAC this spring</li><li>The state is moving to a growth model starting this spring.&nbsp;<ul><li>That means they will be calculating individual student-level growth predictions and scores, as well as &nbsp;</li><li>Group growth scores for all disaggregated populations</li></ul></li></ul><div>They are still struggling with how to represent the growth numbers. The main options are. centered around zero with positive or negative rates and centered around 100 with a range of around 10 and 210 (but growth, by definition, is not bounded at the top or bottom). This will be a big lift to understand for all involved. We should probably start to do our own PD on this at some point. There are also some technical decisions that the State Board has made that have implications for the schools we serve.&nbsp;</div><div><strong><br>California Practitioners Advisory Group Meeting<br></strong>December 11, 2020<br><br></div><div><strong>AGENDA ITEMS<br>Item 01 -&nbsp;Subject:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Information Item Related to California’s State and Federal Accountability System: The Development of a Student-Level Growth Model and the Reporting of 2020 Data.<br><br></div><div><strong>Type of Action:</strong> Information<br><a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/cc/cp/documents/cpagdec11item01slides.pptx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Item 01 Slides(PPTX; 1MB)</a></div>
