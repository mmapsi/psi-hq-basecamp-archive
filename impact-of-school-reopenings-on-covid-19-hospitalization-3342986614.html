      üëç Impact of school reopenings on Covid-19 hospitalization 
      
    </h1>

    <div class="formatted_content">
      <div>Douglas Harris, Engy Ziedan, and Susan Hassig from Tulane University published the following analysis last week:<br><br>The <a href="https://www.reachcentered.org/publications/the-effects-of-school-reopenings-on-covid-19-hospitalizations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">study</a> is the first to examine how reopening schools in-person has affected COVID-19 hospitalizations. We found no evidence that reopening schools in-person or in a hybrid form increased COVID hospitalizations in the 75 percent of counties that had low COVID hospitalization rates during the summer, prior to reopening schools. Our results suggest that it seems safe to reopen schools when there are no more than 36 to 44 total new COVID hospitalizations per 100,000 people per week.<br><br>For counties that had higher rates of hospitalizations in the summer, our results were inconclusive, as they were inconsistent across data sources and statistical methods.<br><br>We used data on essentially all school districts‚Äô reopening plans from Education Week and two private data collection companies, Burbio and MCH Strategic Data. We combined these with information on COVID-related hospitalizations from the company Change Healthcare, which has healthcare claims for 170 million people, roughly half of the entire U.S. population, as well as data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) including essentially all U.S. hospitals. We examined data for every county from Jan. 1 through Oct. 30, 2020.</div>

      <div>Interesting. I can't imagine it wouldn't have a negative impact on cities where the hospitals are already at 98% or greater hospital capacity (like Philly.)</div>
