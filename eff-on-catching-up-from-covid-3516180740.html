      üëç EFF on "Catching up" from Covid
      
    </h1>

  <section>
    <div class="formatted_content">
      <div>The UK's Education Endowment Foundation (EFF) has a thoughtful <a href="https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/news/eef-blog-the-impact-of-covid-19-and-catching-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">blog post</a> up about the importance of diagnostic assessment to understand which students need to catch up with what. Not just the big commercial tests, but smaller assessments that look at handwriting, reading fluency, etc. The author notes that catching up with friends is likely to be the focus for many students. There's a solid, evidence-based self-assessment of learning needs that could be a really powerful tool to engage students in examining what supports they need. <br><br>There's a related <a href="https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/news/eef-blog-summer-schools-what-the-evidence-tells-us-and-what-it-doesnt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">second post</a> on what the evidence around summer school is. There are small positive gains from summer school (+2 months learning gain), but particular forms of small group tutoring (+4 months learning gain) and ensuring pupils receive high-quality feedback (+8 months learning gain) are more effective and cheaper. As we engage with leaders in our respective schools and districts, it is important to help leaders evaluate how best to allocate their resources to support students as they navigate the impact of Covid on their learning.&nbsp;</div>
