      ✨ Why am I seeing former staff members/ unfamiliar faces in our meetings??

      <div>Hi All,<br><br>A quick heads up that the PDS team has a few external contractors that are also former colleagues that are supporting us with projects that we need additional bandwidth to accomplish. You may have seen <strong>Hansa Kaipa</strong> and <strong>Tiara Grayson</strong> in a meeting on Friday or noticed <strong>Carrie Cifka-Herrera</strong> posting in the Alumni Network. Hansa has been supporting Cynthia with some Bay contracts, Tiara is co-leading the district transformation summer work group AND helping with our alumni network, and Carrie has been leading a book study in the Alumni network.&nbsp;<br><br>These three are sure NOT to be the last of some previous employees you will see pop up as contractors. PLEASE don't hesitate to ask for an introduction!!!! And continue to remind us when a broader announcement might be helpful.<br><br>-- Amanda</div>
