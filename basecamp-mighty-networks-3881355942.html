      <div>Hi All,<br><br>Beginning with the first week of Launch our <strong>Monday Announcements will formally move from Basecamp HQ to our staff Mighty Networks page</strong> (currently called "Staff Playground" but soon to be renamed). If you aren't added to that page already, you will be getting an invite soon.<br><br><strong>Wait, how did we decide this?</strong></div><ul><li>Kim collected feedback on systems and communication throughout the year and in April gathered input from a diverse group of Mighty Network and Basecamp users to help us determine the best path forward. Then, Chris made a final call. Here is why:<ul><li>There have been ongoing requests to minimize the number of platforms we have to open every day and many people are already on Mighty Networks</li><li>We are using SmartSheets for complex project management and not using basecamp for very much other than announcements</li><li>We can post some of our conversations in the larger PSI Community on Mighty Networks so that our clients have access to the rich resources that we share and conversations related to them</li></ul></li></ul><div><strong>So will Basecamp disappear?</strong></div><ul><li>No - not right away - not until we are sure we have all the information catalogued and there are no active users/ teams tracking to dos in there without an alternative system.&nbsp;</li><li>Staring with launch week, however, no org wide information will be shared via basecamp, <em>so if that is all you use it for, you can turn off your email notifications beginning August 1st.</em></li></ul><div><strong>How will we use the staff page on Mighty Networks versus the full community page?</strong></div><ul><li>This is a question we will be digging into together during the first week of launch!&nbsp;</li></ul><div>We have had a lot of rich discussions and built relationships and connections with one another on our basecamp HQ page and we are really hoping that energy and conversation will not be lost in the transition.&nbsp;<br><br></div><h1><span style="color: rgb(185, 94, 6);">Tell us, what will you need in order to feel comfortable and excited about a transition to a Staff Mighty Networks page??</span></h1>

      <div>Love this post! Great context for why we're switching and appreciate the timeline and preview of opportunities for feedback. Basecamp PDS announcements were super helpful for sharing/getting feedback in a predictable manner, so would love to continue that practice! In terms of comfort, I just want to be sure I don't post in the wrong place, so whatever that looks like, make it super clear and easy.&nbsp;</div>
