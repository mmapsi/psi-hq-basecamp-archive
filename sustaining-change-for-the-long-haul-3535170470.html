      <div>At the visioning session, one of the directions discussed was placed-based collective impact. This week, the Collective Impact Forum released a new podcast addressing the question, "<a href="https://www.collectiveimpactforum.org/resources/how-do-you-sustain-your-initiative-over-long-term" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>How Do You Sustain Your Initiative Over the Long Term</em></a><em>?</em>" While we might not pursue this specific strategy, the advice about supporting long-term change in the districts we support is completely applicable to our current work. In particular, they ground their advice based on a <a href="https://www.tamarackcommunity.ca/hubfs/Events/CI%203.0/Workshop%20Resources/Sustaining%20CI%20-%20Tool%20.pdf?t=1497903311895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">framework</a> from the Tamarack Institute that lays 7 aspects of <em>The Sustainability Circle</em>.&nbsp;</div><ol><li>Leadership competence - activities that contribute to high-quality initiatives are the responsibility of leaders</li><li>Effective collaboration - involves identifying relevant stakeholders who actively support program goals and have clearly identified roles and responsibilities</li><li>Understanding the community - entails having knowledge of community needs and resources; having respect for community members, and involving key community members in programs</li><li>Demonstrating results - evaluating process and outcomes using acceptable research methods and informing stakeholders of the results of those evaluations is critical</li><li>Strategic funding - includes having plans and resources in place to support current and prospective program requirements</li><li>Staff involvement and integration - the inclusion of committed, qualified staff in program design, implementation, evaluation, and decision making develops a culture that values broad-based participation in working toward program sustainability and success</li><li>Community responsivity - the ability of a CI initiative to adapt programming to meet changes in community needs is critical</li></ol>
