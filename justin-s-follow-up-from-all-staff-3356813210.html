    <div class="formatted_content">
      <div><strong><em>January 7, 2021</em></strong></div><div><br></div><div>Dear Team,</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you again for welcoming me into your all-staff meeting, and for being so considerate and thoughtful in your contributions ‚Ä¶ especially right before the holiday break!</div><div><br></div><div>I‚Äôve been reviewing your notes, and considering our conversations, and I wanted to share a few big picture reflections as I move into the next phase of writing and outlining for the book project.</div><div><br></div><div>First, one of you captured something quite succinctly on a Miro board: ‚ÄúEquity is a through-line, not just a chapter.‚Äù Amen. While there is no secret sauce to the work that Partners does, it seems clear to me that there is something extraordinarily powerful and unique about Partners‚Äôs explicit melding of equity work with continuous improvement work. Too much continuous improvement work exists in a technocratic vacuum, while we all know that it is impossible to move student data without moving adult mindsets. For better or worse, our current national climate creates a context for having more explicit conversations about race, privilege, and oppression, and my instinct is that there will be a significant appetite for a book that adeptly weaves together the technical with the adaptive.</div><div><br></div><div>Second, when reviewing all of your favorite books, it is apparent that a great book cannot stop at moving people‚Äôs hearts and minds, it must also move their feet! We remember books like <em>Savage Inequalities</em>, <em>The Other Wes Moore</em>, and <em>Dare to Lead</em>, because they don‚Äôt just tell us about the world we live in, they give us tools to change that world. Finding the right balance between elucidating our harsh reality, and providing both the tools and optimism to confront that reality, is ‚Äúmission critical.‚Äù</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, one of you offered a VERY tall order in response to the prompt that asked you to write a blurb for the eventual book: ‚ÄúThe definitive guide to 21st century school improvement.‚Äù We should be so lucky! Kidding aside, I do believe that there is space in the world right now for such a book, and I can‚Äôt think of an organization that is better positioned to offer such a text than Partners. The last generation of school improvement was characterized by a lot of emphasis on shiny objects and silver bullets, which came with outsized political strife and, unfortunately, very little in terms of systemic national gains. Partners has a vision for systemic improvement at scale, even though we know that work will not be easy. What will make that work EASIER? Telling the stories of real people who have already DONE it, and getting educators to see themselves and their peers as change agents capable of the same.</div><div><br></div><div>There are many more takeaways, but I wanted to share just a few. Thank you again for being so welcoming, and I look forward to many more opportunities to share together!</div><div><br></div><div>-J</div><div></div>
