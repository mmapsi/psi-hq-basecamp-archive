</bc-mention></bc-attachment>&nbsp; and school leaders on the ESA Middle Grades Impact Team coordinated a panel of 12 students from across their schools. The goal was to give students voice in their classrooms and communities while providing an opportunity for network participants to hear directly from students about topics related to work they are doing.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The results were powerful. There were many moments when students were vulnerable, sharing their fears about mathematics, the impact of virtual learning on their ability to succeed, and the ways that words and actions of their teachers and peers presented barriers to learning.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Hearing from students also surfaced emotions and learning for the teachers and leaders in the audience. Teachers got some concrete ideas for how to support their math students better in a virtual setting. The experience highlighted just how difficult it has been for teachers to feel so little connection with their students this year due to virtual learning, and how that loss of human connection has impacted educators.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Empathy Panel Planning Tips from Uchenna &amp; Amanda:&nbsp;</strong></div><ul><li>Start by getting clear about what you want to learn from the students. The ESA team developed 3 ‚Äúbuckets‚Äù then developed questions for each: Future goals &amp; aspirations, Experience with Mathematics &amp; STEM and Reflections on high school, college &amp; career readiness</li><li>Create an overview sheet to share w/leaders &amp; students that explains how the student empathy panel will work &amp; support consistent communication.&nbsp;</li><li>Help students feel as comfortable as possible expressing their truth by not putting them in a group with their own teachers.</li><li>Ask for more students than you think you‚Äôll need on the panel when reaching out to school leaders - you likely won‚Äôt get as many as you ask for!&nbsp;</li><li>Hold ‚ÄúPre-Brief‚Äù meetings with students prior to the panel to gather their answers in a notetaker - supports students AND the planning of the panel!</li><li>Give educators multiple ways to reflect and take notes during the panel.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div></div>
