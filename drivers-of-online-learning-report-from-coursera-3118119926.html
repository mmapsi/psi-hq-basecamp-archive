</div></bc-attachment>Hey,<br><br>The online learning company Coursera just published a report on "How to Increase Engagement, Satisfaction, Skill Development, and Career Impact Worldwide"</div><ul><li><strong>Actionable takeaways for Instructors:</strong><ul><li><strong>Help learners apply their new skills<br></strong>Hands-on projects and programming assignments can drive 30% higher rates of skill development, in addition to gains in satisfaction and career outcomes. Robust assignments are more difficult but well worth the effort.</li><li><strong>Chunk video content appropriately</strong><br>Shorter videos help learners benefit from the increased flexibility in online learning. Keep lectures under 10 minutes long to improve lecture completion rates by 16% and increase learner satisfaction.</li><li><strong>Leverage in-browser experiences</strong><br>Course completion rates in programming courses with in-browser experiences (like Coursera Labs) are 20% higher than in those with offline programming assignments.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Ensure proper course length</strong><br>Courses that are roughly one month long have the highest completion rates, and ensuring each week covers concepts in sufficient depth is crucial for career outcomes. Guided Projects are great options for delivering efficient, hands-on learning for those seeking to demonstrate their skills.</li><li><strong>Provide opportunities for practice</strong><br>Practice assignments, activities, and in-video questions increase skill development and career outcomes.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Actionable Takeaways for Learners</strong><ul><li><strong>Start strong</strong><br>Learners who stay up to date with their deadlines for the first two weeks are almost twice as more likely to remain engaged until course completion.</li><li><strong>Return frequently</strong><br>Learning multiple times a week increases retention relative to longer and less frequent learning sessions.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Don‚Äôt rush</strong><br>Learners who spend more time watching and reviewing videos complete courses at higher rates than learners who skim through them. Take advantage of the flexible pace and make sure you understand foundational concepts.</li><li><strong>Find the right fit</strong><br>Learners who choose courses that are at the appropriate difficulty level gain the highest levels of skill development.</li><li><strong>Incorporate social learning</strong><br>Learners who participate in discussion forums early on are 25% more likely to complete the course. Engaging with a community helps learners reach their goals.</li></ul></li></ul>

      <div>Thanks Chris. This report will help my coaching at Cal Hills. They have only juniors and seniors so the time with them is short but hugely impactful. The ILT has been working to modify their TOA to include what are sometimes called 21st C. skills such as time management, collaboration, self-driven goal setting in their student goals. They're reflecting on their virtual instruction so far to determine how well they are supporting students to internalize those mindsets. The conversation has been revealing some white saviorism. They're going to dive into Zaretta's book later this year to learn more about the warm demander.</div>
