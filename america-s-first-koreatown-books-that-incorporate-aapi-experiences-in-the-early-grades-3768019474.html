      <div>My final post today, this one in honor of AAPI communities:<br><br><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/us/koreatown-riverside.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NYT, May 14-America's First Koreatown.</a> There was a lot of history here I didn't know. It's part of California history, which in 4th grade we are supposed to learn about, but again, stories are omitted.<br><br>A<a href="https://www.edutopia.org/article/incorporating-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-experiences-elementary-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> post </a>from Edutopia with some excellent book selections here. I wonder, when we and our clients conduct classroom library book inventories, how often do books with AAPI characters appear?<br><br>I appreciated this part in particular by the author of the post:<br><br>"In <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f6bf2323f8cfc2564497b87/t/6048695820a7e841de310846/1615358297187/2017.Bajaj_et_al-AEQ_Rights-Realities+HRE.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">research</a> I’ve done with colleagues, we developed another category to add: the prism. A prism refracts a beam of light into various colors that go in different directions. Similarly, a text that serves as a prism allows for multiple conversations and critical engagements. While windows and mirrors offer opportunities for exploring and reflecting on cultural traditions, holidays, foods, and ways of life that are all extremely important, the prism, when applied to children’s literature, presents the chance to critically analyze inequalities and injustices in age-appropriate ways."</div>
