    <div class="formatted_content">
      <div>TL;DR - Based on your feedback and time of year, there will be NO major changes to the Partnership Strategy Doc template for this school year. See below for what's in store in our efforts to provide more clarity and support for strategy development (as shared at 1/8 WGL).<br><br>========</div><ul><li><strong>Overview tab&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>A link to a resource will be added to support tiering</li><li>Limit change to format to this tab</li><li>This tab is the only tab due on dates listed on the org deliverables dashboard</li></ul></li><li><strong>Request for clearer expectations and more guidance&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>Over the next 2 months, we'll be working on a user guide with exemplars to help us get clear and calibrated on our strategy development work</li></ul></li><li><strong>Cycle tabs/Network Strategy Tab</strong> - there was a lot of great feedback about what's working and challenging with the tabs. One challenge that surfaced is some redundancy between this tab and manager/direct report 1:1 notes and/or coaching notes (and with network scope and sequences for the network tab). While we brainstormed potential adjustments, it didn't make sense to do a major overhaul in the middle of the year. So...<ul><li>No changes will be made to these tabs for this year</li><li>GREAT feedback about what‚Äôs working and challenges - will incorporate when we design v2 for next year</li><li>Continue to explore how to best use the cycle tabs. You CAN adjust format BUT please do so in a way that aligns to the intended purpose outlined above. If you're open to it, loop in Cynthia as you make adjustments (tag her in a comment) so she can learn with you</li></ul></li><li><strong style="color: rgb(144, 19, 254);"><em>A few reminders (especially if you're wondering about who the doc's intended purpose and audience)...</em></strong><ul><li><em style="color: rgb(144, 19, 254);">The intended purpose of cycle tabs is to document our key coaching actions (what we're testing) and to reflect on accomplishments and adjust on a regular basis (weekly or biweekly). This is collaborative work that can be done with Supervisors, teammates, and also in learning systems.</em></li><li><em style="color: rgb(144, 19, 254);">In addition to providing guidance for implementers, PDS also refers to the strategy tabs to better understand how team members are implementing the approach and supporting schools towards goals. It is an artifact we learn from and analyze to draw out trends that inform professional learning and program development.</em></li></ul></li></ul><div></div>
