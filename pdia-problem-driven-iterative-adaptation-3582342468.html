      <div>Harry Fletcher-Wood is a former history teacher who has worked at a number of school improvement organizations in the UK. His blog <a href="https://improvingteaching.co.uk/2021/03/14/better-school-improvement-through-problem-driven-iterative-adaptation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>Improving Teaching</em></a><em> </em>has been a great resource for usable classroom- and school-level practices. This post is about a practical approach to school improvement. Grand plans almost never come to fruition. Schools operate in complex social, political, and economic spaces. Too many factors are outside of the control of educators, building leaders, or even system leaders. <br><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://i1.wp.com/improvingteaching.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/notes-514998_1920.jpg?fit=816%2C535&amp;ssl=1" width="816" height="535" caption="Try again!"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment><br>Harry borrows a program from the Harvard Center for International Development. Small foreign aid programs are typically at the whim of complex local and regional forces. They are most successful when they are narrowly focused on local high-will problems and iteratively chip away at shared problems. This approach builds a self-sustaining improvement capacity. The authors also explore how local adaptive improvement work can actually support developing governance capacity in weak systems. This makes me wonder if we could adapt some of these ideas to help struggling schools and districts to build their self-governance capacities from the ground up.&nbsp; <br><strong><br>What makes Problem-Driven Iterative Adaptation different?<br><br></strong>The hallmarks of this approach ‚Äì known as Problem-Driven Iterative Adaptation (PDIA) ‚Äì are:</div><ul><li><strong>Finding local solutions for local problems</strong>: don‚Äôt copy best practice, work with local teams to solve the problems which matter most to them</li><li><strong>Encourage positive deviance: </strong>encourage experimentation and find people who are solving the problem already</li><li><strong>Iterate and adapt: </strong>experiment, review, adapt</li><li><strong>Scale through diffusion: </strong>create champions who ensure the change is viable, legitimate and relevant (Andrews et al., 2015, 125)</li></ul><div><strong>Further reading<br></strong><br></div><div>The team advancing Problem-Driven Iterative Adaptation have shared their work generously.

      <div>So much to chew on! And of course, I love the visuals! Gates teams were reflecting on differences between ROCI and improvement science/PDSA today. PDIA seems to share a similar starting place, but deviates when it gets to "sequencing." Makes me wonder what practices folks already use to identify which change ideas to pursue and whether those practices are similar to assessing the "space for change." I also see some overlap with design thinking here when it gets to "iterating" and learning...and that part looks a lot like ROCI too. Thanks for sharing, <bc-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSIpZ2lkOi8vYmMzL1BlcnNvbi8yMDAwMDEwMT9leHBpcmVzX2luBjsAVEkiDHB1cnBvc2UGOwBUSSIPYXR0YWNoYWJsZQY7AFRJIg9leHBpcmVzX2F0BjsAVDA=--cccd6a665a586ffeb96a87eeee8e1e97e5c886c6" content-type="application/vnd.basecamp.mention"><bc-mention class="mentionable-person">

      <div>The multiple connections to neighboring improvement strategies is exactly what caught my eye. In the medical model, they often reference the research base (which is huge - 10k RCTs a year are published). We have nothing remotely close to that in education. There are research guideposts here and there, but almost never in a context similar to the one in which one is operating. I think Partners often goes to a handful of well-tested ideas in schools that are socially non-functional. As soon as some great grade-level work is getting traction, local diffusion is often possible.&nbsp;<br>Glad it resonates.</div>
