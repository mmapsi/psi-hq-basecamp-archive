</bc-mention></bc-attachment> for sharing an email from one of everyone's fave mathematicians (Jo Boaler) to alert us that the new Mathematics Framework for the State of California has just released for public comments!<br><br>You can find it <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>!<br><br>Jo pointed out some " highlights of the recommendations in the new proposed framework are these:<br><br></div><ul><li>An asset-based, mindset infused approach, with a strong social justice orientation.</li><li>Reduction or removal of tracking; all students should take the same courses TK-10 and all middle school students should take Common Core 6, 7 and 8.</li><li>An approach to mathematics of “Investigating and Connecting” big ideas. We propose that students do not spend time doing questions for the sake of doing them but investigate ideas with a purpose of “making sense of the world,” “predicting what could happen” or “impacting the future.” The relationship between these investigations and the content and practices of mathematics is shown in the visual below.</li><li>A new definition of fluency - neither number sense nor “fluency” are about speed, they are about flexibility.&nbsp;</li><li>TK-12 chapters on 2 important areas of mathematics – number sense and data science and three Standards for Mathematical Practices."</li></ul><div><br>I am excited for us to explore this more and figure out how to make meaning of it with our schools!</div>
