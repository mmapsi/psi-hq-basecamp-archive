      <div>Here's the description: The latest results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) - often called the nationâ€™s report card - paint a troubling picture of academic stagnation and widening achievement gaps among American students. In a <a href="https://podcastaddict.com/episode/116673114" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">special episode</a>, Harvard University professor and nationally recognized testing policy expert <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty/daniel-koretz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Daniel Koretz</a> joins CPRE Executive Director Jonathan Supovitz to break down the latest NAEP data, and its implications for student outcomes, equity, and education policy. Koretz and Supovitz also discuss the potential value and the future of the assessment in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>This is a really refreshing take on what tests should actually be used for. This would be a good professional development take for all of us. We are going to dig into test results and other metrics this winter - particularly as we get access to the very sophisticated dashboards from CORE and from the School District of Philadelphia. California is going to start publishing value-added (growth) measures this summer. We need to get really good talking about those numbers. The CORE data has some really sophisticated visualization that we should leverage to upskill how we represent data.</div>
