      <div>We know you are busy with STRs, but as we near the close and renew phase, we wanted to highlight his "19/20 Greatest Hit" from <bc-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSIpZ2lkOi8vYmMzL1BlcnNvbi8yMTg1MTE3NT9leHBpcmVzX2luBjsAVEkiDHB1cnBvc2UGOwBUSSIPYXR0YWNoYWJsZQY7AFRJIg9leHBpcmVzX2F0BjsAVDA=--ef41424e5357b9d89e4c7ddf252db954dbbf3f4a" content-type="application/vnd.basecamp.mention"><bc-mention class="mentionable-person">

</bc-mention></bc-attachment>. <br><br>She shared a process for how she did a purposeful Close &amp; Renew with staff at King Elementary School in a time of challenging staff morale at the end of last school year in West Contra Costa. Check it out for ideas &amp; inspiration as you begin planning to support your schools in this process for this school year...<br><bc-attachment content-type="application/vnd.basecamp.horizontal-rule.html"><figure class="attachment attachment--content attachment--horizontal-rule">

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Process: </strong>Over the past few years, Amanda &amp; her school have gotten good at looking back to plan forward. In 2018, they used a Journey Map as part of Close &amp; Renew to connect with positive things when the morale was low/after a challenging year.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Through the Close &amp; Renew process, they generated a culture of shared ownership (vs “principal fix it” mentality) among the staff and teachers. Here are some key steps she took to make that happen:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>Used “obstacles design thinking” process with Close &amp; Renew</li><li>Enrolled key stakeholders - e.g. teachers are part of design, ILT team, resistant teachers - get their feedback in advance</li><li>Enforced attendance at the meeting - built the close and renew meeting into the PD schedule</li><li>Kept the work alive all year - the journey map and obstacles design posters lived - came with them to all the meetings the following year, and the staff used them to inform future decisions &amp; planning. This showed that they were not going away &amp; the value of investing time in the Close &amp; Renew process.<br><br></li></ul><div><strong>Results:</strong></div><ul><li>They have fine tuned the PLP each year using the Close &amp; Renew process, and because of this it has become a key document accessible to all staff.&nbsp;</li><li>This distributed ownership culture has led to increased teacher retention</li><li>In addition, this kind of thinking has helped clarify roles of different teams (e.g. ILT, positive behavior support team, system teams)<br><br></li></ul><div><strong>Resources:</strong></div><div><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o4EH0YoCyC_qJT_rBbnTVjc0PDa7rYxEydSuynT5Pdk/edit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2018 Close &amp; Renew</a></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18aX8r68RY_aYVtRP8zOchiW-i3QzXoWK_A_J2OmckZM/edit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">19-20 King PLP</a> (for context)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TFW6o1q8yrwuxeXf_s74a94bM9PljE_RMWxPMMRD00A/edit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">2019 Close &amp; Renew</a></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Lbf5fNhMDIO0rusPWELzHaRUIYXtNlPU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CLICK HERE</a> for additional Close &amp; Renew Resources in the Known Good Library</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;👇🏻Your turn!
