      <div>Hey all, it was great to see everyone in the data dive this morning!&nbsp; As I briefly mentioned, conversations with teams and PIT data around where folks are in their work prompted us to pull together some resources for setting equitable SMART goals around eighth grade on track indicators.&nbsp; They include:</div><ul><li>An <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Kg89iSNy5FnfsD4LXgwm1AgyEMsXaxg/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Overview</a> of Equitable SMART Goals on EGOT measures- Includes some sample goals as well as a bank of sentence frames that can be helpful in thinking about goals</li><li>A sample <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qxkw6Ptgb5eyXcuU2qLY7ERULUcfNed4VM__fpiM9-o/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">agenda</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rzM-C4qH-u4j7lwSfOEdXRzjF3XejRhWsI7yU-s8WC0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">deck</a> for a process to set goals around EGOT indicators.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Some quick thoughts on leveraging these (and other) resources to support goal setting this year:</div><ul><li>Setting goals based on pre-Covid-19 baselines is probably not very likely to make sense this year.&nbsp; That means it is normal for our goals to be getting set a little later this year as we figure out what our baseline even is for key indicators.&nbsp;</li><li>Many schools and districts may need help figuring out how to even measure and baseline things like attendance/engagement.&nbsp; As was mentioned in the data dive, the PDS team is available to help with thought partnership and/or technical support if needed.</li><li>Depending on the context we may want to set goals around just one of the indicators and roll in more as appropriate.&nbsp; E.g. if we help a district figure out how to monitor attendance/engagement we might be able to kick off a ROCI cycle on that (setting goals, identifying a mini TOA, making a plan, etc.) even if they haven't figured out grading yet.&nbsp;</li><li>While setting equitable SMART-E goals is an expectation these resources are simply potential options to leverage if they make sense in your context.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>If you need any additional support or thought partnership (data support, ideas for protocols, identification of coaching moves, etc.) please email <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="autolinked" data-behavior="truncate" href="mailto:support@partnersinschools.org">support@partnersinschools.org</a> and we'll pitch in however we can. &nbsp;<br><br>Thanks for everything you all are doing to support students and educators during this crazy year! Keep the requests coming and would also love to hear about any successes folks are having with goal setting as well! &nbsp;</div>
