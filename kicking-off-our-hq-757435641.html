      <div>Hey all!<br><br>I just set up this ‚ÄúHQ‚Äù on Basecamp so we have a place to try out company-wide announcements or documents everyone needs access to.&nbsp;<br><br>If you have a quick question and you don't know who to ask, jump into the Campfire and ask away. The Campfire is also good for casual stuff - saying hello to everyone in the morning, sharing interesting links, chiming in on current events, and pictures of cats.<br><br>If you have an important announcement to make, a big idea to share, or you want to say something that you want to make sure everyone hears, post a message on the Message Board.<br><br>A couple other things... Once a week Basecamp may ask you what you plan on working on this week. And then at the end of every day Basecamp may ask you what you worked on today. Just share what you can - it's a great way for everyone in the company to get to know what everyone else is doing on a regular basis.<br><br>If you have questions about anything at all, don't hesitate to ask! Looking forward to getting things started.<br><br>&nbsp;-Pol</div>
