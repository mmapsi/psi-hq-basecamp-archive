    <div class="formatted_content">
      <div>Hey,<br><br>I attended the first in a series of meetings that's part of an extended conference / learning series hosted by Assessment for Learning billed as their <a href="https://www.assessmentforlearningconference.org/winter-launch-landing-page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Winter Launch</a> (watch out for loads of super geeky space and science fiction metaphors - and shade for Star Wars as a western that just happened to be set in space - not science fiction).&nbsp; <br><br>It was a really engaging 3 hours with 1 - 15 minute break. Instead of a keynote, we got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THZpUqLmftk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Alcine Mumby</a> who was our provocateur. She did a brilliant job naming how white supremacy culture shows up in our lives (and in our educational systems) and how we are complicit in its reenactment. She pushed on two aspects and helped us to focus on how it feels in the body - it felt very similar to the work Rahwa and Shawn have been leading in our Friday learning spaces.&nbsp;<br><br>They then short used videos - 3-5 minutes to share a back and forth about different topics - accountability, purpose, measurement, etc. and broke us into small 3-5 breakouts with really clear questions (and micro icebreakers). That generated 3 deeply engaging learning/discussion sessions that created connections between folks who had never met before. Really well designed and executed.<br><br>There is more to come, but I will share that later.&nbsp;<br><br>I took away three things:&nbsp;</div><ol><li>We are on track with the design and execution of our online spaces. The high energy and engaging experience I had in this group were very similar to what I have experienced joining our network sessions over the past several months. Sure, there is always more we could learn, but we are doing good work.</li><li>This is a community we could leverage to support our thinking (and our clients' thinking) about equitable assessment - from the micro to the macro. I'll be following up by joining one project/learning team later this month with the plan to share some concrete resources from that work.</li><li>One of the artifacts shared in this meeting was this&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15fbCo3WmBWtfFzdNy3LojZTtaTIpxO7SiFP5zRYgOgI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Participant Workbook</a>&nbsp;on Grading for Liberation. This connects very well with the work we are doing with some nice supports for engaging practitioners. It also reaffirms our use of the 7 circle model and change management strategy thinking. Getting evidence of convergent thinking from peer organizations is one form of testing our ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>

      <div>Chris, thanks for these takeaways. I love the practices in the workbook and am trying to find ways to leverage it, especially as grading now seems more subjective than ever. Even if we cannot yet change the systems in which students receive grades, changing the mindsets and behaviors of teachers and leaders will have a huge impact on the environments in which students learn and demonstrate understanding.&nbsp;</div>

      Thanks for sharing, Chris! I skimmed through the workbook when Noah sent it out. I had hoped to use it at a webinar that I attended on anti-racist grading. I'm happy to know that Noah is thinking of ways to leverage it.
