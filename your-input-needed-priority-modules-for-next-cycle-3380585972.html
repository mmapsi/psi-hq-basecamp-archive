      Your Input Needed: Priority Modules for Next Cycle

      <div>Hi all,<br><br>As we launch into another cycle (January-March) of work on our content modules project, we'd love to get input from everyone on where you have the most pressing needs for content. Our goal is to align to your needs and to continue to build modules that get used in the work of our networks as well as with individual school sites. <br><br>You can follow <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Idz5vLoA82ar5OLF2MtbnleRocRXnc5LlDsIUPP3prI/edit#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this link</a> to give input on which topics from our backlog we should prioritize.&nbsp; Additionally there is space to identify additional topics that you need content around.&nbsp; Finally, we'd love to hear if you have engaged participants with any content that went particularly well as that is often our best source of inspiration for new modules.&nbsp; <br><br>It shouldn't take more than a few minutes and your input is tremendously valuable in making sure we are prioritizing the right content.&nbsp; <strong><em>If we could get input by next Monday (January 25th) it would be greatly appreciated. </em></strong><br><br>Thanks!!</div>
