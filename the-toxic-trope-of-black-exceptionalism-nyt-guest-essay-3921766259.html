The essay was published in the NYTimes today. The full title is: <em>Black Valedictorians &amp; the Toxic Trope of Black Exceptionalism. </em>Getchew argues that Black valedictorians should be the norm, not the exception, but systems are structurally racist and conduct <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/04/gifted-and-talented-programs-separate-students-race/587614/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">racialized tracking.</a>&nbsp; <br><br>Here's an excerpt:<br> <br>In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/11/im-my-high-schools-first-black-male-valedictorian-i-wont-be-the-last" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">his graduation speech</a> last month (published in the Guardian The Atlantic), Mr. Muhammad (valedictorian this year) pointedly asked why it took 106 years for Oakland Tech to award this honor to a Black male student: “So why me?” he asked. “I don’t know. But for all of those who didn’t get to maximize their potential, for all those who had the ability but lacked the opportunity, I owe it to them to appreciate this history made by the people who put me in this position. We owe it to them to make sure that, while I may be the first young Black man to be our school’s valedictorian, I won’t be the last.”&nbsp; <br><br><br>And <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/09/i-went-yale-my-brother-went-prison/597730/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Here's </a>a link to Akintunde Ahmad's article in The Atlantic.<br><br>If you read this, I would love to engage in conversation.<br><br></div><div><br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div></div>
