    <h1>
      Breaking down the wall b/w ILT and the whole staff
      
    </h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <div class="formatted_content">
      <div>A common structural dilemma at sites is that the is siloed- the rest of the staff is not quite sure what the ILT's role is and/or what they do. When there is a lack of relational trust, some people go up the ladder of inference quickly and assume that ILT members are part of an "in crowd."&nbsp;<br>I'm curious if anyone has done some coaching around how to prevent this from happening, and/or has a cool example to share, or a resource to refer to? Are there any alternative team structures out there? Typically ILT's have been comprised of a grade level representative, and/or a subject area rep. Sometimes there are additional members like a resource teacher, guidance counselor, or AP.&nbsp; Are there different configurations that schools are exploring? Because I've seen this for many years now, I'm wondering about the current structures and processes in schools that perpetuate this unintentional outcome, and what we can do now during this window of innovation to do differently.<br><br>Thanks!</div>

      <div>Thanks for bringing this up, Emily.&nbsp; I've thought about this a lot over the last month through the interviews for STR and seeing that most schools described their ILT membership as mostly at random or teachers signing up for an adjunct duty on a spreadsheet during a meeting.&nbsp; It made me wonder how a structured process to determine grade level or department representatives for ILT could help with the dynamic you are describing.&nbsp; If everyone feels like they were part of a discussion about who represents them, they might feel less of a disconnect to the people on the actual team. &nbsp;<br><br>I also think the chartering process helps to determine a purpose.&nbsp; Do ILTs get to make decisions about instructional program or priorities or are they more of a sounding board for admin who make the ultimate decisions?&nbsp; Do they create PD or are they seen mainly as communication channels for admin to get their perspectives out to the team?<br><br>I don't have any resources to help with this, and a big part of my reflection comes from the mistakes I've made with ILTs (and culture teams) when I was a school leader.&nbsp; But, I thought it might to share my thoughts.&nbsp; Happy to connect and brainstorm ideas together.</div>

      <div>Thanks for sharing your thoughts Jesse R. You mention a lot of good reminders for me about how important the pre-work is in determining what the role of the ILT will be and who is on it. Further, who does the selecting? Too often I have observed leaders choosing those who are most like-minded; while I understand that motivation, at the same time, that move can also deepen divisions among staff. There's no right answer, but your thoughts and my reflection are giving me pause when it comes to coaching leaders for next year. Already most of my leaders are talking as if their current ILT members will return to that position, without communicating the thought processes behind that.&nbsp; More food for thought on this Tuesday!</div>

      <div>No resource to share, yet a past few times I've supported leaders to bring together a team, they have created somewhat of a job description outlining the role and it's responsibilities and then had their teams select their rep, each time required some nudging on the leader's part to get a few key people on the team.&nbsp;<br><br>At another school, I'm recalling a couple years back coaching the leader to determine the primary function of the team for that year and ensuring that vision drove the "who". The school was far along with their PLC work with clear systems in place and thus they didn't feel they needed a grade level rep on ILT and rather had a rep per grade span - TK-1, 2-3, 4-6 plus elective and RSP. They focused mainly on ROCI and PD development/facilitation and the configuration supported vertical alignment nicely and they still had a strong enough perspective on what each grade level may need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

      These are very good points that you’re bringing up, Emily. Definitely love your point around the selection process for ILT members. I see that as competencies. What competencies are leaders looking for in other leaders and high-performing teachers. <br><br>Schools adopt so many names/titles that typically describe their greater leadership team. <br><br>In my experience, leadership team (LT) members consisted all of representatives across the school: Principal, AP, Dean, Counselor/Social Worker, Special Education leads, Operations (attendance, safety, etc.), and sometimes network coaches/outside support. These meetings were consistently held weekly. <br><br>These meetings were used to discuss school progress: academic updates, student conduct updates, attendance, incentives, event schedules and family engagement.<br><br>At times, there were extended LT meetings which included grade team leads. Maybe this was done quarterly.<br><br>Instructional Leadership Team (ILT) consisted of coaches, sometimes this included the principal if the principal coached, content leads, and outside partners that supported teachers. These meetings were held bi-weekly. These meetings were used to discuss coaching, last action steps taken, teacher progress, upcoming PD, intervention, curriculum and assessment, pacing, and problem solving.<br><br>The A-Team (Academic Team) was a structure that was established at a school were I was an assistant principal. The A-Team consisted of assistant principals of instruction and special education who coached teachers. The A-Team included our interventionist, reading specialist, teacher leaders, and at times, network coaches.<br><br>The A-Team was used for calibration. We normed on teacher support, completed 6-week coaching cycle documents, and discussed teacher progress. Sometimes we were arranged in pairs or trios to visit rooms of folks that we did not support and share our observations.
