      üì¢ '21-'22 Program Priorities
      
    </h1>

  <section>
    <div class="formatted_content">
      <div>Thank you to everyone that participated in our collective effort to surface key priorities for the 2021-2022 school year. We have three major priorities that emerged and we are still busy articulating exactly what we want to accomplish relative to each priority, how they connect to one another and how you will experience them in learning systems, program development, evaluation priorities, and new products and services.<br><br><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 240, 219);">Drum roll please:</strong></div><ul><li><strong>ON TRACK MEASURES!</strong> - No surprise to anyone we want to grow our skills at leading the use of on track data in our partner schools and districts. This is NOT because it is a Gates requirement but because the research points to this being a more effective way to set goals, monitor progress, and predict future opportunities for the students we serve. You will see us invest in our ability to communicate how on track measures are connected to our mission, how we use them over the course of the year (think ROCI Roadmap integration, tools and resources) as well as investing in our technical chops with goal setting and data analysis.</li><li><strong>District Transformation</strong> - This may not have been on your radar but we have an increasing number of district coaching and district transformation contracts. We have aging resources and a limited number of staff members that have been able to devote time and attention to this work. We believe that transforming outcomes on a systemic level can be accelerated by working with district partners. We intend to spend learning and resource development time on district transformation this year.</li><li><strong>Coaching</strong> - What is loose and tight about our coaching approach? As we have fewer intensive partnerships our 1:1 and team coaching becomes increasingly central to how we spend our working hours. We want to spend time getting aligned about common expectations, planning and practicing our coaching chops, centering our equity mindsets, and understanding when and how to use the <em>change agent framework </em>in the context of coaching.</li></ul><div><strong>Program leads</strong> - please pipe up if I misrepresented something or left something out!!<br><br></div><div><strong style="color: rgb(185, 94, 6);"><em>What do you think??? </em></strong>Feel free to post a comment. If you would like to have a conversation or provide more input on the scope or focus within each priority, please chat with one of the field staff members on the program team (Megan Kizer, John Zachary, and Ty Johnson) so that they can bring it to the next Program Team Meeting.</div>
