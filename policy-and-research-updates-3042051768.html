      <div><strong>Do measures of instructional practice lead to improved test scores?</strong></div><div>A new <a href="https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/projects/project.asp?projectID=4587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">study</a> finds a link between instructional observation scores (on Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, and Instructional Support) on improved ELA schools in low-performing schools but no impact on math scores. ‚ÄúFor schoolwide achievement, which is measured by the percentage of students who met or exceeded expectations on the state assessment, results show a significant positive relationship between the classroom organization domain and ELA schoolwide achievement. There was no significant relationship between observation scores and schoolwide achievement in ELA for any other domain or for mathematics schoolwide achievement. The relationship between observation scores and current achievement levels may be weak because achievement levels may be influenced by many other factors including students‚Äô prior achievement and the economic and social challenges their families face.‚Äù</div><div><br></div><div><strong>EdWeek publishes great series on going back to school</strong></div><div>There is a multi-part series running in EdWeek on the challenges of going back to school. The sections of <a href="https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2020/09/03/triaging-for-trauma-during-covid-19.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">triaging trauma</a>, teaching <a href="https://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/reopening-schools/teaching-social-emotional-skills-amid-covid-19.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">socio-emotional skills</a>, and <a href="https://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/reopening-schools/covid-19-remote-learning-how-to-make-it.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">remote learning</a> are all worth reviewing.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>What you understand depends on your moral values</strong></div><div>A <a href="https://www.aera.net/Newsroom/Correcting-Covid-19-Misconceptions-May-Require-Speaking-to-Individuals-Moral-Values-According-to-New-Research" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">new study</a> from Ed Researcher explores the impact of moral values on the interpretation of Covid-19 information. The authors ‚Äúfound that people with strong moral concerns for the well-being of individuals were more likely to update their existing Covid-19 beliefs when presented with new information. Conversely, people who place strong moral value on protecting group cohesion and people who value protecting individual freedoms were more likely to reject new information and maintain Covid-19 misbeliefs.‚Äù This strongly suggests that ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù communication strategies are likely to fail.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Interventions to Improve Attendance in Covid-19 times</strong></div><div>Attendanceworks has some useful tools and supporting information to improve attendance in hybrid or online settings based on a <a href="https://www.attendanceworks.org/chronic-absence/addressing-chronic-absence/examples-of-tiered-practices-for-distance-or-hybrid-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">3 tier model</a>. One big recommendation is to go quickly to Tier 2 and <a href="https://www.attendanceworks.org/chronic-absence/addressing-chronic-absence/3-tiers-of-intervention/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tier 3</a> interventions, given the barriers to participation that many under-resourced schools and communities are experiencing. Sacramento City did a presentation with Attendanceworks on August 26, 2020.
