      üëç Understanding propaganda

      <div>The Harvard EdCast just released a new podcast on <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/21/03/harvard-edcast-propaganda-education-digital-age" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>Propaganda Education for a Digital Age</em></a><em>.</em> The guest, Renee Hobbs, director of the Media Education Lab at the University of Rhode Island, describes education around understanding propaganda was a part of ELA instruction until the rise of the standards movement in the 1990s. At that point, the standards shifted to focus on argumentation - messages based on logic - rather than messages based on emotion. Hobbs notes that only a small fraction of schools cover propaganda at all. When they do it is almost always focused on Nazi Germany and for a handful of schools, propaganda associated with WWI.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition to not providing students with the tools to identify and understand appeals to emotion, this gap in instruction also ignores positive propaganda. Collective action - both negative and positive - routinely relies upon emotional arguments to focus on the greater good. From our own work, we know from experience that evidence - the logical argument - is never enough, we need to be able to connect to our and our clients' emotions to deliver real change.&nbsp;<br><br>I really enjoyed this refresher on propaganda. You might as well.</div>
