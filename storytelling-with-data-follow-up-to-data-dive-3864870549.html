      <div>Hi all,<br>&nbsp;<br>Thanks for diving into story telling with data for those who were at the data dive today! I wanted to share another resource that I just remembered for visual storytelling. Has anyone heard of <a href="https://www.pechakucha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PechaKucha</a>? Presentations are given using 20 chosen images, each for 20 seconds. From their website, "you've got 400 seconds to tell your story, with visuals guiding the way. PechaKucha means "chit chat" in Japanese. This creative outlet began as nighttime get-togethers in Tokyo in 2003 by two renowned architects. Since then, three million people have attended PechaKucha events worldwide." Anyone attended one? <br><br>Also here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uLuU87ehHY6_ioBfsI8Ws3l5uX-Bwli-qd7mfmfyEFI/edit#slide=id.p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">case study template</a> that I know <bc-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSIpZ2lkOi8vYmMzL1BlcnNvbi8yMTg1MTE3NT9leHBpcmVzX2luBjsAVEkiDHB1cnBvc2UGOwBUSSIPYXR0YWNoYWJsZQY7AFRJIg9leHBpcmVzX2F0BjsAVDA=--ef41424e5357b9d89e4c7ddf252db954dbbf3f4a" content-type="application/vnd.basecamp.mention"><bc-mention class="mentionable-person">

</bc-mention></bc-attachment> is already working into her TOI storytelling. Anyone else planning to use creative/visual storytelling methods (drawing, video recordings, poetry, etc)? Please share your thoughts here!&nbsp;<br><br>As I look to plan the sharing session at launch, it will really help to have a sense of how folks want to tell their stories! More details about the launch planning coming soon!<br><br>Thanks,<br>Sarah May</div>
