      üëç The Association between Teachers‚Äô Use of Formative Assessment Practices and Students‚Äô Use of Self-Regulated Learning Strategies

    <div class="formatted_content">
      <div>Formative assessment is a set of practices that enable students and teachers to track progress and adjust learning and teaching during lessons as needed, ideally leading to more dynamic learning in classrooms. A <a href="https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/projects/project.asp?projectID=4625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">new <strong>REL West</strong>&nbsp;study</a> examined survey results for more than 1,200 teachers and 24,000 students in three Arizona school districts about teacher formative assessment practices and student learning activities in their classrooms. The study found that:</div><ul><li>Teachers frequently gave students feedback but less frequently provided occasions for students to provide feedback to one another. Students frequently tracked their own progress but less frequently solicited feedback from their teacher or peers.</li><li>Only a small positive association was found between the frequency of teachers‚Äô formative assessment practices and the average number of self-regulated learning strategies that their students used. The correlation was stronger in elementary school than in secondary school and stronger in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) classrooms than in non-STEM classrooms.</li><li>Some of teachers‚Äô least frequently used formative assessment practices‚Äîfacilitating student peer feedback and self-assessment‚Äîhad stronger positive associations with the average number of self-regulated learning strategies that their students used than the more frequently used practices.</li></ul>

      <div>2 high school teachers presented on the purpose, design and use of rubrics in the classroom in one of the sessions at the CDE assessment conference in October. One of their suggestions was to construct rubrics together with kids-even younger ones-and to teach kids how to give constructive feedback so they can use the rubrics and do so in pairs. Powerful stuff.</div>

      <div>Right on Emily. I've seen that used in the past in a middle school that adopted standards-based grading, portfolios, and problem-based learning back in the late 1990s. That's the work I was doing when I started collaborating with Derek when he was still at UCLA. Students (and parents) were involved in the creation of many of the rubrics. Also, all math courses used student results from formative assessments as part of their number sense, proportional reasoning, etc. instruction - lots of relevance and agency for the students.</div>
