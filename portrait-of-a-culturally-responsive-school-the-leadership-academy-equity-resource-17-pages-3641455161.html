      <div>The<a href="https://www.leadershipacademy.org/covid-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Leadership Academy</a> has some helpful publications. The one attached is divided into 8 areas, followed by indicators and reflection questions after each one. I could see using some of the questions during STR focal groups or leadership interviews. The indicators are great as well, and could be used as a tool for site teams during an equity walk or something similar. It's a very accessible and readable resource. Don't be put off by the number of pages.<br><br>Samples: <br><strong>Area 1: Equity and Access</strong><br><strong>Indicator</strong>: <br>(1) All staff members are familiar with the varied demographic groups in the school, the neighborhoods students live in, and the cultural and linguistic traditions each possesses.<br>(2) Remote and in-person school assemblies, special programs, and speakers reflect the diverse nature of the school and larger community and/or bring a diverse set of ideas and experiences based on gender, race, ethnicity, disability and ability.<br><strong>Reflection question:</strong> What opportunities do we provide for students to authentically engage with members of the community who come from different cultures and backgrounds than themselves?<br> <br><strong>Area 2: Mission, Vision and Core Values<br>Indicator:&nbsp; </strong>The school‚Äôs mission, vision and values are lead factors in moments of crisis.<strong><br>Reflection question: </strong>How are we re-imagining ourselves as a culturally responsive community of learners that transcends the traditional borders of ‚Äúschool‚Äù?<strong> </strong><br><bc-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSIuZ2lkOi8vYmMzL0F0dGFjaG1lbnQvMjY2NzU0MzI4P2V4cGlyZXNfaW4GOwBUSSIMcHVycG9zZQY7AFRJIg9hdHRhY2hhYmxlBjsAVEkiD2V4cGlyZXNfYXQGOwBUMA==--5b56d4e9152dd058706bd61b87df5c84de2710bc" content-type="application/pdf" url="https://preview.3.basecamp.com/3507828/blobs/b98aed4a-9740-11eb-bb6d-a0369f6bed60/previews/full/Portrait-of-a-Culturally-Responsive-School.pdf" href="https://storage.3.basecamp.com/3507828/blobs/b98aed4a-9740-11eb-bb6d-a0369f6bed60/download/Portrait-of-a-Culturally-Responsive-School.pdf" filename="Portrait-of-a-Culturally-Responsive-School.pdf" filesize="3237857" width="1224" height="1584" previewable="true"><div class="attachment attachment--pdf attachment--pdf attachment--preview attachment--exported">
