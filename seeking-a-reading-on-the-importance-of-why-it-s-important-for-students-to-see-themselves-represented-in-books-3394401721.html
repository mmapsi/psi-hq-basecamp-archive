    <h1>
      Seeking a reading on the importance of why it's important for students to see themselves represented in books
      
    </h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <div class="formatted_content">
      <div>One of our WCC POP teams is focused on building a culture of reading with their Kg and 2nd grade AfAm boys. I am looking for an article, blog or perhaps an academic study (the abstract only is good!) about the direct connection between reading growth and representation. So far, the boys are excited to see characters who look like them in the books they've been introduced to. The boys are hooked. So what next for their teachers? How would these observations inform the subsequent lessons she is planning, beyond simply getting more books with representation? Too often I have teachers end the work there. Having more representative books on the shelf is a start, but what comes next? Thanks.</div>
