    <h1>
      üëç Mastery vs. Seat Time Under Remote Learning
      
    </h1>
  </header>

      <div>EdWeek provides a <a href="https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2020/11/04/will-competency-based-learning-now-take-off.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">good summary</a> of the current state of understanding and policy support for mastery-based learning. The author explores the impact of Covid-19 and remote instruction that may be accelerating this move (while probably not shifting the important policy framework that would be needed to support the mastery-based education at scale). What jumps out at me is that mastery-based grading is at the heart of the <em>equitable grading</em> recommendations that come out of the on-track research we are leveraging. The other thing that sticks out (and is also addressed in the equitable grading recommendations) is that this is a huge professional learning and change management challenge. Even districts that have been at this for years struggle to make progress and change educator practice.</div>
