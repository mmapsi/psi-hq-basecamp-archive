      üì¢ PIT Guidance and Updates!

      <div>Happy Monday!<br><br>In our last Dave Dive we calibrated around 5.2.3 (a coaching item in the cycle phase). After reviewing the notes, I wanted to summarize the common ground as guidance for your next cycle review.<br><br>Tips to remember when completing item 5.2.3 for this year:</div><ul><li>Coaching relationships and cycles may look somewhat different this year for a variety of reasons (being responsive to coachee needs, limited access to coachees, inability to meet one to one, unable to observe, using short term goals and adjusting as we go).</li><li>Coaching frequency, objectives and style should look different in different models.</li></ul><div>Success for 5.2.3&nbsp; includes:</div><ul><li>Assess progress to date on goals (goals might not have metrics attached or be annual goals, but there is something that the coachee is intentionally working on, ideally aligned to a framework such as CAF, STR, a district framework).</li><li>Results in an adjustment or shift of some sort on the coachee's part (maybe even shifting to a new goal?)</li><li>Includes reflection on ways of working together</li><li>Coachee must be bought into the goal and the coaching relationship for this to be full success.</li></ul><div>Success for some might also involve observing the coachee, having both short and long term goals that are measurable and ensuring that reflection happens in a single one to one coaching conversation. But these pieces are not required.<br><br>Here's what else you should know to stay on top of your PIT:</div><ul><li>In our next data dive, we'll be looking at trends in PIT data as we also make connections to the Close &amp; Renew phase. Agenda coming soon!</li><li>Please make sure your PIT is up to date! After April, we will no longer be marking off items from the Parter, Set Goals, and Plan phases.</li><li>Watch out for a Tableau Dashboard update coming soon! We will be replacing the full line item description with a shortened version. Full line item description will still appear in some of the pop ups when you hover.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Thanks!<br>Sarah May</div>
