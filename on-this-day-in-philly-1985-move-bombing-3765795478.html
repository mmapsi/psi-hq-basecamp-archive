      <div>Sharing <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/philly-health-commissioner-dr-thomas-farley-resigns-over-handling-of-remains-of-move-bombing-victims/2813602/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this</a> article with you all about the MOVE bombing that occurred on this day, May 13, 1985 in Philadelphia. Philadelphia police attacked the home of Black liberation and environmentalist group MOVE with automatic weapons, then dropped a bomb on it, killing 5 adults and 6 children, destroying 61 homes in the predominantly Black neighborhood, making 250 people homeless. You can read the article to learn more. Very few people know about this and discuss it. To be honest, I learned about this gruesome event last year while planning an interdisciplinary unit on advocacy. A few grade teams planned to focus on Philly history (1775 - Present Day). One topic that we considered exploring was the MOVE bombing to have students think about advocacy across subjects. Teachers were tasked to backwards plan and identify content, standards, and skills to align to the topic. Last month, April 2021, it was revealed that anthropologists at Princeton and UPenn had the bones of one of the children killed in the bombing, unbeknownst to the families. Just sharing with hopes of raising consciousness and inspiring action.&nbsp;</div>

      <div>Thanks for sharing, Ty. I had no idea about this event until seven years ago when I was observing a senior seminar class and the teacher lectured about it. I was riveted, but it left me feeling pretty ignorant. The MOVE bombing really speaks to a lot of issues of racism in Philadelphia and its history. Thanks for enlightening us with this!</div>

      <div>The fact that the MOVE bombing has been "lost" in the history books&nbsp; demonstrates the critical importance of centering and holding up the voices of those with lived experience. Who's telling the story, and who's story is it? &nbsp;<br><br>Thanks Ty.</div>

      <div>I learned about the bombing of MOVE families when I was in grad school in 1986. I was in Italy and starting my 2-year program in crisis management and decision making. My prof was from the French Center for National Security Studies. She compared the attack by the Philly police to Soviet tactics to suppress dissent in Hungary during the 1956 and 1968 uprisings that were ended using extreme violence. &nbsp; The term we used then and still rings true is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_warfare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">asymmetric conflict/warfare</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
