The study included 41 teachers in the control group and 71 teachers in the intervention group, composed of 45 teachers who delivered the intervention for one year, and 26 teachers who delivered the intervention for two years. Both groups included K-12 teachers and early childhood educators. Intervention teachers received a half-day in-person training on trauma-informed practice, and a full-day in-person MindUP training, in addition to another full-day extension training in the spring. The training for MindUp was offered by a trainer from the organization managing the program. After receiving the training, intervention teachers implemented MindUP in their classrooms throughout the school year. The intervention involved 15 weekly lessons and the implementation of the core practice of the program three times a day. Comparison teachers received the same training and resources in the following year.&nbsp;<br><br>After one or two years of the program implementation, teachers who delivered the intervention utilized significantly more trauma-informed practice (+0.16). In particular, among the five subscales of the Attitudes Related to Trauma-Informed Care (ARTIC) scale and the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the effects of MindUP were significant in teachers‚Äô self-efficacy at work (+0.16) and reactions to work (+0.27).<br><br>These findings indicate potential benefits of SEL interventions for teachers who deliver them, in addition to the benefits for students already shown through multiple studies. While this study is a mixed-methods study using both quantitative and qualitative data, we only introduced the quantitative findings of the study.&nbsp;</div>
