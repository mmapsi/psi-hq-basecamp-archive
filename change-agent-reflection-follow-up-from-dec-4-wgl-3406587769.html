      <div>Hello all, <br>For those of you who participated in sharing and reflecting on change agent stories during Dec. 4th WGL, we are following up to share some highlights and trends from your stories. In the interest of radical transparency, we wanted to make the data available to all. Please check out <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UqzGqeiwSo7O4-LN8NfNuUWl8diEfbO1yAzH_k733WM/edit#slide=id.g8655ead6d9_0_38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this slide deck </a>to learn more about how your colleagues reflected on their stories.&nbsp;<br><br>As we continue our midyear reflection, we hope this deck offers additional insights for you! We enjoyed learning alongside you through this reflection process, and thank you for helping us test and deepen our evaluation methods for change agent development. We're planning to engage in a similar process later this spring.&nbsp;<br><br>If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or Mercy.<br>Thanks,<br>Sarah May</div>

      <div>As someone who just joined Jan 2021, I appreciate this data sharing. I want to read more of the individual stories submitted, but so far, most salient to me is the words used most - hopeful, energized, and focused. We can channel this energy during our work this year.<br><br>However, as shown in Slide 10, how do we encourage individual action to become more collective efficacy? It was comforting to see that overarching strategy is apparent, but it is also warranted to address the urgent needs felt by those on the far right of the spectrum on Slide 11. Personally, I am working on <em>learning from others</em> rather than <em>coaching others -&nbsp;</em>a perspective that I've greatly appreciated during the last three weeks. Slide 14 feels so&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qzRvq-NuS6iVdr7dJtoXshqbkJ02xHXN/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>Below the Green Line</em></a><em> </em>to me - how are we moving towards relationships, rather than structures and processes?&nbsp;<br><br>What do others think/feel?</div>
