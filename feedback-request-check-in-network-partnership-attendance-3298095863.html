      <div>Hi Everyone,</div><div><br></div><div>First, thank you for all your due diligence in administering the digital Network Attendance and Network Eval Response Forms (NERFs) at each of your network sessions. I know we say this often, but we are in unprecedented times, and your commitment to ensuring our network health measures are collected provides us helpful data to ROCI related to our network health.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>That said, we are approaching mid-year, and I think this can also be a good time to reflect on their use and purpose:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>How is the process of using a virtual attendance form going? (e.g., how easy or difficult is it to complete during your session)</li><li>Are the network attendance forms being completed accurately? (e.g., do they appropriately reflect who is attending or are you finding it difficult for people to sign in)?</li></ul><div>Thank you for your engagement!&nbsp;</div>

      <div>From my perspective, both forms are going well. We have almost all participants complete the attendance when we share the link and QR code. We send it again at the end of the convening. Some people who came late will sign in then; additionally, we have some people who sign in twice. Where does this data go internally? After each session, I track our attendance and cross-reference with a district stakeholder in case someone didn't sign in, but am not sure what PSI does with attendance internally.&nbsp;<br><br>The NERF is also obviously really useful. Most participants are completing it when we share the link and QR code, but we still are still not at 100%. (Inspired by Gates NSI convening sessions, I was hoping to raffle off a prize at the end of sessions for people who sign in and complete the NERF to incentivize it and build a sense of joy, but being virtual and mindful of budgets, we held off on this.)<br><br>I'm interested to hear about what other groups are doing around this.&nbsp;</div>

</bc-mention></bc-attachment>&nbsp;Yes, she tracks it for herself and follows up with people that weren't there, came late and sometimes with people who were there but didn't sign in. I make sure to give ample time to sign in and let people know "100% of people who are here need to sign in." I tried the same language with the NERF (given it's anonymous) but it doesn't have the same clout as signing in, knowing she'll follow up if not.&nbsp;</div>

      I'd say our attendance stuff is working fine.  Looks like people are doing it.  I am considering withholding the link until people fill out the NERF.   I could have the link to the attendance doc be part of the "thank you" response people get after submitting the NERF.  Thoughts?
