    <h1>
      üëç DQC update on federal and state assessment plans
      
    </h1>

    <div class="formatted_content">
      <div>The <a href="http://dataqualitycampaign.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Data Quality Campaign</a> (DQC) just posted an update on state-level requests for waivers to federal assessment requirements (and the U.S. Dept. of Ed's responses). There is a very wide range of requests flexibility by states as well as local actions (e.g. groups lobbying parents to opt out of testing). In particular, many groups have expressed concerns about the equity implications of testing under remote learning. The conditions for testing could vary so widely that the results would be uninterpretable. The post calls out a new report from NWEA and Education Reform Now that suggests both short- and longer-term adjustments to state and district assessment strategies and ways to measure the opportunity to learn. The post points to work in Oregon as an interesting shift to administering a <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/assessment/Pages/Student_Educational_Equity_Development_Survey.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Student Educational Equity Development</a> survey that looks at what resources students have available to them and their opportunities to learn.&nbsp;</div>
