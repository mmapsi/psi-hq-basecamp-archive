      <div>Hi All,<br><br>I have been adapting the use of our interview and focus group guides to suit the context of the year, the school, and my own style. I thought it might be nice to have a group conversation about what we are learning and how we are adapting the tools.<br><br><strong>Framing</strong> - I loved Mallory's mock framing with the stuffed animals and Charlie. I have been adding a few additional comments:</div><ul><li>We considered not doing the STR this year because it has been such a hard year, but we have heard so much feedback from schools over the years that the review process truly helps inform their reflection and planning for the upcoming year. So much learning has taken place this year! <strong>This is not about what you might not have been able to accomplish this year, but about all the things you DID accomplish and all the things you learned. </strong>Our intention is that we gather trends that can help you plan for the year ahead.</li><li>Normally we visit classrooms - this year we weren't able to, so <strong>I am going to rely on you to be my eyes and describe what has been taking place</strong>, to the best of your ability.</li></ul><div><strong>Questioning</strong></div><ul><li>I have been using the <strong>chat feature</strong> to <strong>ask people what they are most proud of this year</strong>, to get the conversation going.</li><li>For focus groups, I have been <strong>preparing by ranking the top 5-7 questions</strong> I want to get to and putting them in order.</li><li>I have been <strong>preparing in advance for what to do if more than 15 ish people join</strong> (break out rooms, chat). It hasn't happened yet for me, though.</li><li>I have been<strong> using the guide loosely</strong> - but really <strong>asking questions that I know I need to answer to in order to score the line items with evidence</strong>. I have been <strong>relying on the host </strong>to help prioritize. &nbsp;</li><li>To probe, I have been actually <strong>using the language of "quality" "consistency" and "frequency"</strong> a lot.&nbsp;</li><li>For classroom practices, I have been <strong>asking really targeted questions about the instructional line items</strong>, like, "How have you been checking for understanding and then providing feedback this year?" - If I get a vague answer, I say, <strong>"What would I see if I were in your virtual classroom?"&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><div><strong>Closing</strong></div><ul><li>I <strong>thank people profusely</strong> for their time and especially for all their hard work this year.</li><li>I <strong>share when they should be hearing back</strong> from their leader about what we learned (if I know)</li></ul><h1><strong style="color: rgb(185, 94, 6);">What tricks have you been using?? What have you learned???</strong></h1>

</bc-mention></bc-attachment>! I like the suggestion to use chat and to norm on the # of participants that would prompt use of breakout rooms. <br><br>Based on my own experience this year and the calibration debrief form, very targeted questions around instruction do seem helpful. I like your examples. I tried asking about higher order thinking in a focus group and got some crickets though. <br><br>Also from the calibration debrief form, most groups said the evidence from the teacher focus groups and leader interviews was extremely valuable, along with host knowledge. So it's definitely worth sharing what we're learning about gathering that evidence! Here's a snapshot how different evidence types are informing scoring: <br><bc-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSIuZ2lkOi8vYmMzL0F0dGFjaG1lbnQvMjcyMDM2MDYyP2V4cGlyZXNfaW4GOwBUSSIMcHVycG9zZQY7AFRJIg9hdHRhY2hhYmxlBjsAVEkiD2V4cGlyZXNfYXQGOwBUMA==--e14f6c4beea787ffa2c4474c81dbece32956395f" content-type="image/png" url="https://preview.3.basecamp.com/3507828/blobs/32683a82-a6dd-11eb-a9d2-a0369f6bed45/previews/full/image.png" href="https://storage.3.basecamp.com/3507828/blobs/32683a82-a6dd-11eb-a9d2-a0369f6bed45/download/image.png" filename="image.png" filesize="77098" width="1488" height="598" previewable="true" presentation="gallery"><div class="attachment attachment--image attachment--png attachment--preview attachment--exported">
