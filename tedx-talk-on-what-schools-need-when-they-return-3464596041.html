      Thanks so much for sharing this, Alex. I believe that families are often excluded in black and brown school communities. I liked that the speaker mentioned family engagement as the first priority. That point made me think about another comment that I heard recently -- some students have learned things during the pandemic, such as baking, that will not show up in the curriculum. This shifts the narrative from a deficit-based discussion i.e. "skill gap" to asset-based, and helps to learn about the lives of students and families outside of the classroom.  <br><br>Lastly, rethinking assessments and the way students receive feedback vs our traditional grading systems which is sometimes rooted in bias and/or compliance. All great stuff. Thanks again.

</bc-mention></bc-attachment>. I keep wanting to yell back at the presenters in podcasts that same point. Students have been doing nothing. Their parents and other caregivers have also learned a bunch about what schooling is like for their children. They have also not been exposed to toxic school environments and instead are with family members who love and care about them. It's not like many schools were being wildly effective before the pandemic hit. Clearly, some students are going to benefit, if only from being free of that influence.</div>
