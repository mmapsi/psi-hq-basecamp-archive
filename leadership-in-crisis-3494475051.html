    <h1>
      Leadership in Crisis
      
    </h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <div class="formatted_content">
      <div>There have been several things coming across my feeds in the last week that focus explicitly on leading during a crisis. The latest CPRE Research Minutes' most recent podcast "<a href="https://www.researchminutes.org/episode/educational-leadership-in-challenging-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Educational Leadership in Challenging Times</a>" was an interview of the authors of a recent <a href="https://repository.upenn.edu/cpre_workbooks/2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">guide</a> for leaders - Jonathan Supovitz and John D'Auria. They position Improvement Science inside a framework of relationships and caring that leaders need to display. In particular, they focus on how leading in a crisis is different from normal times. <br><br>I've also taken a close look at a <a href="https://www.cognitive-edge.com/the-loci-of-competence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">blog post</a> from Dave Snowden of Cognitive Edge that compares the competencies for leaders in the&nbsp;<a href="https://globalpmstandards.org/2021/02/launch-of-a-guiding-framework-for-leadership-in-complexity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>Framework for Leadership in Complexity</em></a> and competencies for systems in <a href="https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC123629" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>Managing complexity (and chaos) in times of crisis</em></a>. I really appreciated his comparison of the more simplistic notion of the leadership competencies located only in the leader and the notion of the need for leadership competencies to be distributed - particularly as complexity increases.&nbsp;</div>

      <div>Thanks for sharing, Chris.&nbsp; A quick skim led me to page 18, which briefly describes the Plan-Do-Study-Act process (similar to ROCI and the NYC Improvement Science Handbook).&nbsp;<br><br>In addition, this quote from Roland Barth stood out to me:<br><br><strong>The Fractal Nature of Schooling</strong><br>I‚Äôve yet to see a school where the learning curves of the youngsters are off the chart upward while the learning curves of the adults are off the chart downward, or a school where the learning curves of the adults were steep upward and those of the students were not. Teachers and students go hand in hand as learners - or they don‚Äôt go at all.<br>-Roland Barth, <em>Learning by Heart</em></div>
