      <div>Hi all,<br><br>Hope everyone is having a great start to their week!&nbsp; As we work to continue to build out our content modules library, we've been asking network leads for input on where we most need content. Excited to share two new modules that were sparked by staff requests for content:<br><br></div><ul><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17iG1Y1wfurS-lzFbVdMdJt-KnGwYW5ZA?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Family Engagement: Building Learning Partnerships</a>- This module focuses on the power of true learning partnerships between educators and families, unpacks the opportunity the shift to remote learning provides to reimagine learning partnerships, identifies potential barriers schools put up that inhibit learning partnerships with families of color, and gives participants time to explore strategies that have been shown to be successful. &nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19eF0tpRUAP4g2sXn9Xg6TeBZKXqrWI0m?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Classroom Observations in a Virtual Environment</a>- This module focuses on supporting leaders to figure out observations and "walkthroughs" of instruction in a virtual setting by grounding in the why, exploring tools and resources and thinking about how to modify existing practices for a virtual context, and finally creating a plan to engaging in virtual classroom visits.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>These modules are always a group effort- huge thanks to everyone who requested, contributed, drafted, reviewed, etc.!!&nbsp;<br><br>Would love to hear from anyone who tests these out and keep the requests coming! &nbsp;</div>
