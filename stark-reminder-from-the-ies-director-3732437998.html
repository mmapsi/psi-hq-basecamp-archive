      <div><a href="https://ies.ed.gov/director/biography.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mark Schneider, Director of IES</a> (IES = U.S. Dept. of Education, Institute for Education Science) writes in his most <a href="https://ies.ed.gov/director/remarks/5-4-2021.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">recent blog</a> that while the pandemic has been a terrible social and learning experience for many students, we were actually experiencing a downward trend in outcomes for underserved students before the virus took over our lives. While the decline is significant, it is also largest for those students already furthest behind. We would be misidentifying the challenge if we focus only on the challenge presented by Covid-19. We need to design for the larger challenge.</div>
