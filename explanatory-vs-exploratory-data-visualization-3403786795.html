      üëç Explanatory vs Exploratory Data Visualization

      <div>The Urban Institute has a really interesting newsletter (Data@Urban) that sometimes produces longer Medium posts like <a href="https://link.medium.com/8QiV3jlmjdb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this one</a> (authored by Jon Schwabish). Much of what we are trained to do in social science data analysis is to focus on the upper left quadrant. That's where most static representations we get in dashboards lie. I think we are going to be exposed to more exploratory tools in our on-track work. Many of the graphics represented in on-track reporting show the prior trend and a prediction for the grade level, classroom, or individual student "if we do nothing different". This is really different from simply reporting the current status. In addition to suggesting we have agency in changing the prediction, the variance in predictions by school, classroom, group, etc. also shows us where work is going on that is producing different trends - both positive and negative. <br><br>This is a new type of visualization for most of us and for the school-level consumers of dashboards in ESA or Philly. Unfortunately, the tools are not always organized in ways that easily differentiate between explanatory and exploratory visualizations. Just as I have suggested in recent meetings that we will need to up our game to really understand what growth measures are telling us, these new visualizations will also require that we provide support for educators to focus on the most effective tools as well as the scaffolding to understand their use. <br><br><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*c6esKj-cKiA2jurLy4mayQ.png" width="800" height="632"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">
